        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Nozomi Mae, a student at the Ohio State University. I am currently working towards an
          undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering, with a focus in software engineering.</p>

          <div id="item1-info" class="additional-info">
            I mostly stick to analog games like (Sprider and Klondike) Solitaire, Nine Men's Morris, Backgammon,
            President, Hanafuda, Blackjack, Mancala, and UNO. I often play them with <a

              Classics</a> on the Nintendo Switch.

          <div id="item2-info" class="additional-info">
            I love reading fictional books, though I don't have a preference towards a specific genre. Most of the books
            I have are in Japanese (passed down from my mother), which takes me a little longer than reading in English,
            but I prefer spending time absorbing every word and phrase offered. My mother owns a lot of picture books
            and it's fun to read those as well!

          <li class="list-item" onclick="toggleInfo('item3')">೯ Travel and Culture</li>
          <div id="item3-info" class="additional-info">
            I dream about travelling around Europe, with all its beautiful architecture and cultural diversities. I also
            love going back to my motherland, Japan, because my hometown harbors many childhood memories that I hold
            dear.

          <div id="item4-info" class="additional-info">
            I enjoy learning about many things, and I strive to understand the materials in my college courses.
            Outside of school, I pay attention to world politics and international relations through a multitude of
            media sources.
            I also enjoy learning history to further increase my intercultural competence.
            In my free time, I like to study German, French, and Russian, though I haven't made much progress since I
            have been passive about this objective.
